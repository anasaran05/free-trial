Your supervisor, Ms. Rhea Patel, Quality Assurance Supervisor, needs you to ensure the lab’s Quality Management System (QMS) is on point. You’ve been tasked with checking if the lab’s batch record-keeping follows the QMS rules outlined in the SOP. Your job is to review the SOP, compare it to a lab observation, and fill out a Compliance Verification Form to confirm if the process is compliant or flag any issues. This keeps the lab’s operations safe and reliable, like a well-coordinated army following its playbook.

CheckList:
1. Review the SOP for batch record-keeping.
2. Compare it to a lab observation to check compliance.
3. Complete the Compliance Verification Form (100–150 words) to report your findings.
